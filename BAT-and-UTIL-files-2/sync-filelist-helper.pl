#USAGE: sync-filelist-helper.pl FILELIST.txt D:\DESTINATION\FOLDER\
#USAGE: Refer to code for controlling behavior via environment variable or via trigger file


#HISTORY: This is the generalized 2ⁿᵈ edition of the more-specialized “sync-mp3-playlists-to-location-helper.pl”, which only sync’ed playlists [and not the files], whereas this usually/also sync audio files.



##### CONFIGURATION: BEHAVIOR:

my $COPY_SIDECARS                      = 1;							#set to “1” to copy sidecar files (i.e. subtitles, art, lyrics, any file with same base but diff extension)
my $PUT_EACH_SONG_IN_RANDOM_FOLDER     = 0;							#set to “1” for each file to be individually copied to a random folder name, which allows a smulated shuffle on the MANY standalone speakers (almost all of them) that don’t have shuffle functionality
my $COLLAPSE_FILES_TO_ROOT_WHEN_DONE   = 0;							#set to “1” to move all files to the root folder when done; useful for players that can only do random in a single folder
my $COPY_FLACS                         = 1;							#set to “0” to not copy FLAC files, if you are dealing with an older player that doesn’t support them
my $COPY_IF_TARGET_FILE_EXISTS         = 0;							#set to “1” to run the copy /u command on target files even if they exist. Although this won’t copy if the file is the same, the comparison to determine that takes time, and this can REALLLLLLLLY slow down an update that may only be 1% of the files to take possibly as long as the same amount of time for updating 100% of the files... So we usually keep this set to 0!

##### CONFIGURATION: INTERNALS:

my $COPY                           = "*copy /u /g /h /j /k /Nst";	#set to “copy” if you must - but for me, /u makes it an update copy, which only copies if the file is newer. Significantly saves time. /g=percentage progress. /h=copy hidden, /j=restartable, /Ns=no summary ("1 file copied" suppressed), no updating JPSTREE.IDX
my $MKDIR                          = "mkdir /s /Nt";				#set to   “md” if you must - but you're gonna need to add whatver option lets you this make multiple folders inside each other at once, i.e. creating "c:\one\two\three\four" in one command, not four.  The /Nt is a TCC-specific speedup.
my $SLASH                          = "\\";							#set to    “/” if you must [Unix folk]
my $ALLOW_COPY_TO_SAME_DRIVE       = 0;								#set to “1" if you want to allow copy to the same harddrive, WHICH CAN BE REALLY BAD, this was set to 0 for my own protection...  HISTORY: 2025/06/21 - changed this back to original inception value of 0 after a disaster .... 2022/03/17 - changed this to 1 for testing purposes ... original pre-2022 inception value was 0
my $BACKSLASHES                    = 1;								#set to 1 if you want all filename slashes to be turned into backslashes (usually better for Windows)
